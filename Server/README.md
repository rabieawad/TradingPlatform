## Used liberaries and Frameworks
Javalin : Javalin is a very lightweight web framework for Kotlin and Java which supports WebSockets, HTTP2 and async requests. Javalinâ€™s main goals are simplicity, a great developer experience, and first class interoperability between Kotlin and Java.
jckson : Jackson has been known as "the Java JSON library" or "the best JSON parser for Java". Or simply as "JSON for Java".
java.time :  The main API for dates, times, instants, and durations.

java.util.ArrayList :Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. In addition to implementing the List interface, this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list.
java.util.List: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. The user can access elements by their integer index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.
java.util.objects:This class consists of static utility methods for operating on objects. These utilities include null-safe or null-tolerant methods for computing the hash code of an object, returning a string for an object, and comparing two objects.
Lombok :Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, automate your logging variables, and much more
